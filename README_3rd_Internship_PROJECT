🔍 Objective:-----



Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, duplicate, or incomplete

data within a dataset. Messy data leads to unreliable outcomes. Cleaning data is an essential

part of data analysis, and demonstrating your data cleaning skills is key to landing a job. Here

are some projects to test out your data cleaning skills: 





🛠️ Tools Used:-----



 Python, Pandas , Matplotlib , Seaborn 





Key Aspects of the Project:-----



1. Data Integrity: 

> Ensuring the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of data throughout the

cleaning process.

2. Missing Data Handling: 

> Dealing with missing values by either imputing them or making

informed decisions on how to handle gaps in the dataset.

Duplicate Removal: Identifying and eliminating duplicate records to maintain data uniqueness.

3. Standardization: 

> Consistent formatting and units across the dataset for accurate analysis.

4. Outlier Detection: 

>Identifying and addressing outliers that may skew analysis or model

performance.
